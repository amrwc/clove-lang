Constant reassignment:

It's allowed to reassign nested values of 'constant' objects...

const list = [10, 20, 30]
list := [10, 20, 30]
list[1] = -17
list := [10, -17, 30]

const obj = { foo: 'abc', bar: 123 }
obj := {bar: 123, foo: abc}
obj.foo = -20
obj := {bar: 123, foo: -20}
obj['bar'] += 7
obj := {bar: 130, foo: -20}

...because they're not really 'constant', only the reference to them is.

Therefore, it's not allowed to reassign a 'primitive' constant:

const primitive = 789
primitive := 789
primitive = 'something else'
"primitive" is a constant and cannot be reassigned.
